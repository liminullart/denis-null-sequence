## Appendix A: Revival Mechanism (PSAP)

**Polar-Stasis Activation Protocol (PSAP)** — proprietary multi-factor revival framework, consisting of five simultaneous triggers:

1. Temperature: ‑31 °C ± 2.3 °C  
2. Atmospheric Pressure: 0.76 atm (~2200m elevation)  
3. Relative Humidity: 28%–33%  
4. Geomagnetic Anomaly: Localized ionization shift activating dormant enzyme  
5. Genetic Resonance Trigger (**EchoLock**) aligned with the T‑Zero magnetic cycle  

These FIVE conditions — collectively PSAP — are singular, original, and exclusively tied to the **Denura Project**.  
The combination is not reproducible in any natural or artificial setting outside this project.
