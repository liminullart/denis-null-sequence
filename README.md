## Appendix A: Revival Mechanism (PSAP)

**Polar-Stasis Activation Protocol (PSAP)** — proprietary revival framework consisting of five simultaneous triggers:

1. **Temperature:** -31 °C ± 2.3 °C  
2. **Atmospheric Pressure:** 0.76 atm (~2200m elevation)  
3. **Relative Humidity:** 28%–33%  
4. **Geomagnetic Anomaly:** localized ionization shift activating dormant enzyme  
5. **Genetic Resonance Trigger (EchoLock):** aligned with T‑Zero magnetic cycle  

These conditions are uniquely tied to the Denura sequence.  
The combination is non-reproducible in natural or artificial settings beyond this project.
